## Status
Accepted

## Context
The API must provide predictable, client-friendly error responses and follow
correct HTTP semantics. Ad-hoc error formats and vague status codes lead to
fragile client implementations.

## Decision
- Use RFC 7807 (Problem Details for HTTP APIs) for all error responses
- Return `application/problem+json` consistently
- Use precise HTTP status codes:
  - 400 for client validation errors
  - 404 for missing resources
  - 500 for unexpected server failures
- Define all error types centrally in `errors.md`
- Treat error definitions as part of the public API contract

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clients can reliably parse and handle errors
- Clear separation of client vs server responsibility
- Error handling is testable and documented

### Negative
- Slight upfront cost to define and maintain error catalog
- Requires discipline when adding new failure cases

## Notes
Any new endpoint or failure scenario must:
1. Map to an existing error type, or
2. Introduce a new documented error via ADR update
